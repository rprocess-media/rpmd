### ﻿The Anointed Ones at the End Time #1
#### The Epiphany: Life and Anointing
#### Bro. Lee Vayle - February 15, 1987

Heavenly Father, we're very grateful again to know that You're here, that the Lord Himself descended with the Shout, with the Voice of the archangel, the Trump of God. And already we've heard the Shout which we know to be a message putting the Church in order, giving us revelation and wisdom concerning the hour in which we live, not only that, but concerning You Yourself; but not only that, but concerning the events and that which pertains to us. We're grateful for that, Lord.

We pray You'll help us in that study this morning which we know to be a very crucial one which we know the world's turned down, but which we have received positively without reservations, knowing it to be true for it settled so many doubts and fears and misunderstandings in our own lives that we can hardly commend it to all people even as You commended it to all people, O God, bearing witness to You what You have done. So, help us in this study, Lord, that Your Name might be glorified, the people built up. In Jesus' Name we pray. Amen.

You may be seated.

1\.	Now, the message we're taking is *"The Anointed Ones at the End Time,"* and of course, we're very familiar with this subject. We've discussed it in many ways and many times, that is, the contents of it. And we shouldn't have too much difficulty going through it quite rapidly, as I say, because we know what it is about. That is we know what it is about thematically, perhaps not in all the details, and some of those details could be brought to our attention.

2\.	Now, Bro. Branham was reading on page 3, from Matthew 24, especially verses 23–27, but he started in verse 15.

> (15) (And) when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, (standing) in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)

> (16) Then let them which (are) in Judaea flee into the mountains:

> (17) Let him which is on the housetop not come down (or) to take any thing out of his house:

> (18) Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.

> (19) And woe unto them that are with child, [and] to them that give suck in those days!

> (20) But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:

> (21) For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.

> (22) And except those days should be shortened, there no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.

> (23) Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or (lo) there; believe it not.

> (24) For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

> (25) Behold, I have told you before.

> (26) Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.

> (27) For as [the] lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

> (28) For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered [together]. 	

3\.	Now, the important verses that I mentioned are beginning with 23, [Matthew 24]

> (23) Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or (lo) there (is Christ; lo here, there); believe it not.

> (24) For there shall arise false Christs, (even lying) prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, (the very elect would be deceived).

> (25) Behold, I have told you before.

> (26) Wherefore if they [shall] say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.

> (27) For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and (shines) even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

4\.	Now, the verse 25, *"Behold, I have told you before,"* is an interpolation, and It reads much better when that is left out.

> (24) For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets [...] (rather we should say, [Matthew 24:23] Lo, here is Christ, or lo there is Christ; believe it not.)

> (24) For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.

> (26) Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.

> (27) For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.

5\.	Now, if you notice these scriptures here, speaking of deception, and you notice that chapter 24 starts with Christ being questioned.

> (3) [And] as he sat upon the mount of Olives, (they came privately), saying, Tell us, when (these things shall) be? [and] what shall be the sign of thy coming, and [of] the end of the (age)?

And It continues right through chapter 24 where you see the division of the people, the wheat and the tares separated---where the wheat go into the garner and the tares and chaff are to be consumed---and then he begins to make comments before the 24th chapter ends, and he goes into the 25th chapter continuing the same theme. And these verses that Bro. Branham brings out here are concerning the deception which is so great that God Himself literally not only allows, but perpetrates, according to 2 Thessalonians.

6\.	This great deception, I believe, is spoken of in the 25th chapter [of Matthew], verses 1--13.

> (1) Then shall the kingdom of heaven (at that time, you see; the 					kingdom of heaven shall) be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

Now, 'the kingdom of heaven' there, many people take it to mean that which is a kingdom overall where there are the wise and the foolish, there are the evil and the good. In other words, it's a great kingdom that God has set up---in the beginning was very fine but begin to deteriorate through sin and all. Well, whatever. But he uses the terminology here, then, the kingdom of heaven likened unto ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.

7\.
> (2) And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.

> (3) (And) they that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:

> (4) But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.

> (5) While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.

> (6) And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom (Behold, the bridegroom; the word 'cometh' is not in the book there.); (come out) to meet him.

> (7) Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.

> (8) And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.

> (9) But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.

> (10) And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that 	were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.

Now, you notice in there before He actually came, the cry was, *"Behold Him."* And you really don't behold anything unless there's something there to behold, which means 'to see it.' So, there was something to see at that time before there was an actual coming together with the Groom, the Bridegroom.

8\.	[Matthew 25]

> (10) [...] and (so) they that were ready went in [with him] to the marriage: and the door was shut.

> (11) (And) afterward came [also] the other virgins, saying, (That's the foolish virgin.) Lord, Lord, open to us.

> (12) (And) he answered and said, Verily I [say unto you, I] know you not. (Or I used to know you as my wife, but I don't know you as my wife anymore.)

> (13) Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour (when) the Son of man cometh.

Now, I believe that those verses there which I read describe 23--26, which we've already read in Matthew 24.

9\.	Now, you see, in Matthew 24, then the 23rd verse, you'll notice It says:

> (23) Then if any man shall say, Lo, here is Christ, or there (is Christ); believe it not.

Now, to me that's pretty well Matthew 25:6, where It says, *"Behold, the Bridegroom."* See, because that is what they are literally saying in another portion of Scripture in another way. And then again Matthew 24:23, *"Behold, He is here. Behold, He is someplace else,"* is to me Matthew 24:27, the last part of the verse, *"So shall the coming of the Son of man be,"* so therefore, that word, of course, is Parousia which is Presence. So, you've got to understand that this is not something that is fake. This is not a little parable, a little illustration, of a little fluke, a little fake that is being perpetrated, a little con game, a little shell game---which shell is the pea under? It is not that. It is something that is real. There is sufficient here to let you know that this has to do with the Presence because that was the question. How will we--- What will be the sign of Your Presence? Now the sign of the Presence is, to be valid, there must be a presence there and that is what we are looking at. See? And we want to understand that.

10\.	Now, with this in the 25th chapter, there is a manifestation or there is a beholding of a presence also. This again is not an illustration, simply a little parable. It's not that at all. It's actually an absolute truth that there will be an Appearing, there will be a Presence, there will be an authority, and the claims to authority will be erroneous, but what is behind the claim as to something that is genuine being there, that in itself is correct. Now, you see what I'm getting at? There has got to be truth before there can be a lie. There has got to be the truth before there is a deception. There has got to be something that points you and doesn't deceive you before there can be something that points you wrong and deceives you. Do you follow what we're saying?

So that's why we're looking at the 25th and the 24th [chapters] and putting them together to let you know that there is something real here and this is to be taken as a very real thing at the end of time. So we see that Matthew 24:23 warns us against men trying to direct us to Christ.

11\.	And It tells us in verse 27 that His Presence shall be one that He Himself reveals, as the same outraying in the West as it was in the East. Now that's what Bro. Branham taught and that is true. Bengal brings that out himself when he says, *"As lightning cometh out of the East."* Now he said, and it is true, lightning doesn't have to come out of the East; lightning can come out of the North. I've stood and seen it come out of the North. I've seen it come out of the Northeast; I've seen it out of the Northwest, come out of the West, Northwest, West, Southwest, South, Southeast, and back, any place. It can split up across you. But he says, he puts it to the direction, and so Bro. Branham in the Spirit was catching the full revelation that other men full of the Spirit in their age could only get a part of it. And Bengal understood that it was something from the East. It had to be that direction.

So, also he brought out that this is not lightning which is...such as the chain lightning or something which has some previous, what you might call it, clue or portent or sign or noise or something that lets you to know that it's going to come. It's not going to come that way. It is going to come suddenly but it's not like a chain lightning; it's like a light, what we used to call, maybe, a heat lightning or what you would call a sheet lightning. It is more of the fact of a light, you know, an outraying, more than like something which is a chain lightning or we think of a thunderbolt and a lightning bolt. He understood that.

12\.	And as Bro. Branham said, *"The light as the sun that rose in the East sets in the West,"* which is true because the civilization traveled with the sun, so does the gospel travel and we've seen it travel. So what started over there ends here, and when it ends in America, then it would naturally go back to the East. Now you'll not tell the fundamental theologian that. He's not going to believe it. And yet, if they were truly fundamental---which they are not, see, because they don't have the Holy Ghost, they're not fundamental of God---but the old [fundamentalist religious] did have the Holy Ghost and men like Bengal would appreciate and understand a prophet.

It's as Bro. Branham said, *"If Arthur Pink were living, he would accept this."* Those men were true theologians in the sense of a divine revelation that took them as far as they could go. That's as far as they needed to go. They didn't have to come this far. So, you can see here that the coming of the Son of man, the Presence of the Son of man is going to be shrouded by deception. It is not that he's not there. It is not that there's not a true voice. Because, you see, it sounds just like there's going to be a whole lot of voices precede the true voice. That is not so. No! What it is, at the time when there is a true voice, a true something, somehow God knows, we, at this point, except for enlightenment, would not know. Somewhere, somehow there would have to be an indication---which we know would be vindication---of an authoritative voice to say, *"Behold, the Bridegroom."* Unless you want to take that to every age and flounder at this age. You can't do it. There was no voice until this age. Now, there's wise virgin and foolish virgin through all the ages, and they kept coming out. But there has to come a time when you do behold Him. There has to come a time when there is Presence. There has to come a time when the Lord descends with a Shout. All of these things there has to be. And this is what we are looking at in this particular hour.

13\.	Now, so therefore, we see that Matthew 24:23 warns us against men trying to direct us to Christ, and tells us in verse 27 that His Presence shall be one He Himself reveals because It tells you here, *"So shall also the coming of the Son of man be."* He's going to be His Own Light from the East. What is Eastern light? Naturally, the gospels; It shall be one He Himself reveals as the same outraying in the West as it was in the East. This ties in perfectly with Luke 17:20.

> (20) And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered [them] and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:

Now, 'the kingdom of God,' specifically---theologians tell us---is the true kingdom of God Himself, though the heavens is over everything specifying God is in control directly, though indirectly in some areas, having let Satan take certain formula, certain power and all. But this kingdom of God then is positively the kingdom that God has reserved for Himself. Now, that isn't really true because you can use kingdom of God, [and] kingdom of heaven in Scripture both ways. But they've sort of done this. I don't mind what they do; it's all right. We understand anyways what a true kingdom of God is. Is going to end up as only the wheat. There won't be any tares in it. And all plants that He has not planted are going to be rooted up. So, all right. They've got to go. Okay.

14\.	[Luke 17]

> (20) [...] The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:

It comes, but it will not be observed. In other words, there will not be something there that man himself can tell you that this is it. Do you follow what I'm saying? Therefore, whether we want to recognize it or not, to become privy to this that we can apprehend It, that we can make It useful, that we can get a hold of It, and It get a hold of us, it's going to take something other than the events themselves transpiring so, then, by them we would know. You can't do it because it comes without observation. But it doesn't say it won't be there. It will be there but man won't be able to grasp it. Now you know that's exactly John the Baptist and Jesus Christ in the first physical Coming. There's no way you can get that out of your mind if you know anything at all about Scripture. There was no way they could know.

You say, *"Well, the thing is they would have to know, positively, by the fact of the grandeur of the ministry of Jesus Christ that this was it."*

Hogwash! The Scripture confirms they didn't know. And those that were in the know, on the grounds that this would have to be God somewhere. But what is it really? They had to come like the rest of them came when they said, *"Tell us plainly, are you the Christ?"* So the kingdom of God does not come with observation. I'm sorry there's none of us here this morning---and I'm standing here, so standing or sitting---that's smart enough to get it. I'm sorry. So, okay, dumbbell, sit there. Be smart enough like dumbbells to shut up and listen, not to me, but to the Word of God because, you see, there's got to be something happen. Now, the issue is further confused by those that claim to have the ability. See? That's right. And they're going to make an awful good stab at it on grounds that they feel they have every right to do it. Now, that's what we're looking at here.

15\.	Now, He said here, *"He's going to come."* He said, *"Actually the kingdom of God is in the midst of you."* Now, here's a man that's the human body of God. And the life that is in the body of Jesus is not human life per se. It is God life, pure and simple, period, which you and I cannot claim like he claimed it. God took every one of His attributes and put it in a little bit of Spirit which He clothed chemically, physically, an egg and a sperm, got a surrogate mother, brought forth a body for Himself. That is the Son of God. No problem.

And He was entirely vindicated and proven by Scripture as to who He was, and yet He could stand there and say, *"The kingdom of God is in the midst of you. It came without your observation."* Nobody could say, *"See here, see there, do this, do that,"* except John the Baptist could point it out. That's all. No other person could do it. He was the prophet foreordained to it. Nobody could do it. Jesus could stand there and say, *"He's in the midst of you right now, and you don't have a clue. And you've seen everything. You see Scripture fulfilled. You see the very thing right here, and you cannot apprehend it. There's nothing you can do about it."*

16\.	 [Luke 17]
> (22)	(Now) [and] he said (to his disciples), The days will come, when (you) shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and [ye] shall not see it.

> (23) And (they'll say), See here; [or,] see there: (Don't try to follow them, because it's going to repeat like this.)

No people can point you, and at the same time there's got to be a Voice that can do it or phooey on the whole thing. Forget it, because then the whole thing's up for grabs again.

*"Well, I'm elect, bless God. I know this. Oh, I'm elect, bless God. I know this. I'm elect, bless God."*

Oh, shut up and forget it. You've got the same miserable hodge-podge and clamor of voices as out there. So then you can see where the elect are absolutely up for to being deceived---if it's any other way, then some way to be pointed to it. So you see, this is wide open for deception in this hour.

17\.	
> (24)	(Now) For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of [the] one part under heaven, (One part. What was the part? Back East.) (and) shineth (to) the other part [under heaven];

So, It tells you the light shines in parts, until there's no more parts. It took seven parts to get us to the West, to America where the prophet was born. He tells you.

> (24)	[...] so shall [also] the Son of man be in his day.

What? Light, a part of light until it's the end part under the Seventh Seal and no parts left, then He's all here in the form of the Holy Spirit. So here He is.

Now, first in the human flesh what they couldn't receive when He stood in the midst of them as the kingdom of God, now that one's got to suffer. So, what you see in verse 24 in our time is preceded by verse 25, his physical death.

> (26) (Then our time is) as it was in the days of Noe, (a prophet) so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.

> (27) They (ate and) drank (Now, that's some of the things going on...) and the flood came, and destroyed them [...]

> (28) Likewise [...] the days of Lot [...]

Homosexuality rampant---a whole city of men perverted. There wasn't one man outside of Lot that wasn't homosexual. Now they're dying like flies. I got a report yesterday from a friend of mine in Canada. He said, *"Up there---"* What do they got twenty-six million people? We've got about two hundred and twenty five million people here. He said, *"The report came out there was over eight hundred some cases up there and already four hundred and some died."*

It's rampant in Canada. It's rampant everywhere. Now, there's another thing coming up they say it's very bad, too. It goes by initials. I forget what it is, but it's looming very, very large on the horizon and millions and millions are getting it.

18\.	That's why I said in the little preamble, take care of yourselves. It will be worth it to you. It's not going to just fall on you. So we ought to start smarting up. I didn't ask for what I got. I was a victim of what the doctors did. The doctors had the answer. They had the answers, sure, the answer to put me in the grave either by killing myself or just dying off. If you want to get your mind blown, I'll give you a dose of it. It's just as good as AIDS. It will get you there. I think AIDS are faster. So just take care of yourselves. You're living in a day of deception. Satan fools you that you can do this and do that, science so-called; so, you've got to look at these things. All right.

19\.	These homosexuals, their homosexuality. The whole town was that way; the whole world is going that way. See? Even animals got it. Fire and brimstone came down. Why? God's got to burn it up.

> (30) Even thus (it will) be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.

Now It tells you there is a revelation of Him which is the same thing: *"Behold, the Bridegroom. Behold, He's here. Behold, He's there."* The answer is then--- It's just like, pardon the expression, but it's like the old game you play, *"Button, button, who's got the button?"*

*"I've got Him,"* said the Methodists.

*"I've got Him,"* said the Presbyterians.

*"I've got Him,"* says the Catholics, *"in fact our pope is the great leader."*

*"I've got Him,"* says the Anglicans. *"We're next to the Catholics."*

*"I've got Him,"* said the...the Pentecostals said they got Him, because they talk in tongues.

Who's got Him? See? Where is He? Now, It says, it's not going to be by the way people think it's going to be. It's going to be even worse. It's going to be trickier, so to speak. It's going to be very, very difficult.

20\.	So, Luke 17:21, *"Lo, here; lo, there,"* you're back to Matthew 24:23, *"Lo, here; lo, there,"* and back to Matthew [24:] 27 again, *"like the light coming."* Thus the Parousia, which is the Presence, is also the start of the Epiphaneia of 2 Thessalonians the 2nd chapter. That's where you see the 'Epiphaneia,' the 'out-shining.' And we're going to look at that word, too. Verse 8 [of 2 Thessalonians 2]:

> (8) [And] then shall (the) Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his (Parousia).

Who shall destroy? And I'm here to tell you this morning, as far as I am concerned, the Epiphaneia of the Parousia right now is the start of when the literal confrontation takes place and Satan is not only thoroughly exposed, he is thoroughly disposed of---because he's going to be. And also, that same Epiphaneia and the Parousia is the Phaneroo which is unmistakably God manifested, though turned down by the world, because that's the way it's got to be. Okay.

21\.	I want to read you concerning the epiphany. The 'epiphany' is taken from the Greek 'epiphaneia,' and it's a good liturgical word. It's a good word scripturally. It's a good word, period. You can use it in politics or any way you want to use it, because it's a word in the English language. It means appearing. So Bro. Branham said, *"The Appearing is not the Coming, so the Epiphaneia is the Appearing."*

Let's watch the word: *"becoming manifest, an appearance, manifestation of one's presence."* So the Presence cannot be known unless there is Epiphaneia. So, there's got to be. It's got to start here. *"[It is] used especially with reference to appearances of deity."*

22\.	Jeremy Taylor wrote in 1835, *"Him,* (That's Christ.) *whom but just before they beheld Him transfigured and in a glorious epiphany upon the mount."* In other words, it was a manifestation of exactly who and what He was.

So, you see I preached for years now, all of these words have started here. Like Bro. Branham, *"The Shout, the Voice, the Trumpet, it's all started in the descent,"* and he explained what every one was. When I was understanding by Daniel's Seventieth Week, that the Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him would come into the Church, I understood exactly, then, what we were into which was that Presence---the Holy Spirit coming up through the Church until He came into Headship, until all that God poured in here was now here Himself: the baptism giving way to the Baptizer, the Baptizer Himself.

23\.	Now reading from mythology: Every nineteenth year we're told the god Apollo himself appeared to his worshippers about the vernal equinox, and during a long epiphany would harp and dance in the sky until the rising of the Pleiades.

The epiphany is, of course today, celebrated; it's a combination of the birth and the visit of the Magi and so on. It's called the twelfth day of Christmas, which doesn't mean a thing to us, but it's in literature. So, what we're seeing here, then, is this Appearance, this Parousia, Epiphany, Phaneroo, Apocalypsis; the whole thing is a part of God's Word that lets you know that at the hour of the truth of all of these words which is *"Behold, the Bridegroom,"* and the cry will go forth because they know something is in the making. *"Behold, we have it. We have it."*

It is going to disconcert people to the extent that only the very elect are going to see through it and come out, in Bride. The rest are going to be deceived. This is God Himself bringing about the deceit, even as He has done it before. Remember, God deceived Ahab by allowing a lying devil to come down and go in the mouths of legitimate prophets of Israel so they couldn't do right. They had to be false to the Word of Almighty God. Okay.

24\.	Let's then begin to go into the subject as Bro. Branham did. We got a little background of our own here just to kind of get things moving. All right. Now, he says here in paragraph 15: [65-0725M]

> [15]	*Now, for a subject, I would like to take verse 24 to emphasize this verse for our Sunday school lesson this morning. And listen closely while I read this, again.*

> (24) *For there shall rise false Christs,* (and lying) *and false prophets,* (a literal translation would be, For there shall arise false Christs, even lying prophets) *and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very* (elect).

Now, in Deuteronomy 13 you will see the false prophet, and in Deuteronomy 18 you will hear about the true prophet.

25\. And maybe we better just read that because, look, there's some good material there in both of those places. So, all right. Chapter 13 of Deuteronomy, verse 1:

> (1) If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder.

> (2) And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof (the Lord) spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, (but) let us serve them;

> (3) Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.

Do you know what I just read there? It says there's going to be a bunch of prophets come on the scene that are not of God. He allows them; so therefore, He perpetrates the deceit to see if you'll fall for the deceit. And It says right here they will have dreams, and they will tell you things that actually come to pass, and they will take you off the Word of God. Now, he says that. Now It says [in] verse 4:

> (4) You shall walk after the LORD your God, (in fear), and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him. (Now, remember, God could only say that after the true prophet Moses was on the scene, not before. No way.)

> (5) And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way (of) the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in. So shalt thou put evil away from the midst of thee.

26\.	Okay, let's go to the 18th chapter [of Deuteronomy] now. Let's read something there Verse 15:

> (15) (And) the LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;

> (16) According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.

> (17) And the LORD (God) said unto me, They have well spoken [that] which they have spoken.

> (18) I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, (I) will put my words in his mouth; [and] he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him (to speak).

> (19) And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

> (20) (And) the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

> (21) And if thou (shalt) say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken? (You see, it's pretty tricky now, you're getting it here and also in Deuteronomy 13. Now, watch!)

> (22) When a prophet (speaks) in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken [it] presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

In other words, there must be--- The vindication of a true prophet is to come and say, *"In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,"* which is what we would say today. He might have said back there, *"In the name of Jehovah,"* or whatever name---one of the titles God gave or several titles. He would predict what would come to pass, then having come to pass, he would say, *"This is my authority whereby you listen to what I have to say."*

27\.	Now, let's go a little further. Let's go back to Numbers the 12th chapter. We get something even deeper. Now, verse 6, he said to Miriam. God said:

> (6) [...] Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and [will] speak unto him in a dream. (Now, that is Deuteronomy 13. Okay. Now, watch!)

> (7) My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house. (Now here's another kind of prophet.)

> (8) With him I (will) speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, (That means in some in view by means of a shape: angel, Pillar of Fire. I don't know. Cloud. I don't know, but it's going to be there.) and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: (whatever likeness it is) wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?

Now, they could speak against the rest and get away with it. They even could speak against Jesus, making him the devil and get away with it. But when you get a prophet like this you can't get away with it. You're finished. Now William Branham made the claim. There's the scientific picture. Do what you want with it. I don't care what you do. Nobody has to believe. Not going to believe anyways unless you're elected. And that can mean you're completely stupid or you're very, very smart---spiritually speaking---to believe that. You have to be dumb as a mule or whatever, smart as an owl. There it is; something over here, too. Scientific.

You say, *"Well, I don't believe that."*

That's fine. Go ahead.

28\.	Brother Branham said, quoting, he said, *"We have not had a Moses...a prophet like Moses who spoke face to face with God for two thousand years since the time of Paul till now. There's the evidence right there if you want to take it as evidence."* Now that's only part of the evidence. Because, remember, God can appear in signs and wonders; God can manifest a presence.

I can manifest a presence of electricity which you cannot see. We've got infra-red downstairs right now. If you all want to make a test we'll just have Joe set it and we'll all walk through and you listen to things start...the whistling and the screaming and the sirens start going, calling the cops. It's there. You can't see it, but it'll manifest. So therefore, we'll see what we're talking about? For this end time there are going to be prophets at the end time deluging the church, literally out to destroy all faith and turn every single creature over to the devil, so that God would have to come and destroy utterly because remember, He destroys the foolish virgin should they be standing here and not already taken in death by the churches against them. Do you follow? Okay.

29\.
> [16]	*Now for a subject this morning, [...] I want to take:* "The Anointed Ones at the End Time." *That's the subject I wish to speak on [...] :* "The Anointed Ones at the End Time".

> [17]	*I believe we are living at the end time. I think most anyone, such as the Scripture reader, or even a believer, knows that we are now at the end of the history of the world. There will be no use in writing any history, because there won't be anybody to read it. It's at the end time.*

Now, that end time, of course, is under the Seventh Seal. Time runs out. Grace runs out to the Gentiles. All these things running out. It runs out, period, even for the Jews because the Seventh Seal actually is revelatory, placing the time and the Sixth Seal is already broken. There's nothing that hasn't broken. It's all ongoing. And the Seventh Seal concludes it all. It ends up even Malachi 4: God burning utterly, leaving neither root nor branch.

30\.
> [17]	*Now it's at the end time. Just when, I do not know. Just how long it will be, not even the angels of Heaven know that minute or hour. But we've been told by the Lord Jesus that when these things that we see now begin to come to pass,* (That's about these false prophets, see, with their signs and wonders, etcetera.) *then we are to lift up our heads for our redemption is drawing nigh.*

> [18]	*Now, what 'drawing nigh' means, I do not know.* (Well, he'll explain it what 'drawing nigh' means, is 'how long is it going to take'. See?) *...don't know. I do not know. It may mean as the scientists said the other day, on the television, speaking of the great thousands-of-miles break in the earth that's going to sink.* (That's the San Andreas.) *He was asked the question,* "It could sink there?" *(That's Los Angeles, the west coast.) And many of you saw how they followed it with radar, and went up through and broke in below San Jose, went over into Alaska, out through the Aleutian Islands, about two hundred miles out in the sea, and came back down into San Diego, went around in behind Los Angeles, and came up there, a great pocket.* (That's, again, the San Andreas fault.) *And all these earthquakes we've been having is the volcanic pressure hitting this great hollow dipper* (looks like a dipper in there). *I can't call the name of it.* (It's the San Andreas.) *However, when that shakes, that gives these earthquakes we've been having for years on the West Coast.*

In other words, the pressure just keeps jarring because it builds up. Now there's a pretty big ridge there, and one day it's just going to blow apart. It's going to come up. You see, like your two hands pressing, there comes a time when something's got to give this way, that way, or the other way. It's got to give.

31\.
> [19]	*Now, and a man was speaking to a scientist, and the man said to the scientist,* "That could fall in?"

>*The scientist said,* "Not 'could,' but 'it will.'"

> *He said,* "But not in our generation, perhaps?"

> *He said,* "In the next five minutes, or the next five years. We just don't know when."

So therefore, when it says here, the time is at hand, you know, how long it's going to happen; he doesn't know the answer. It could be like he said in the Seventh Seal, *"Maybe ten years, twenty-five, a hundred, maybe yet tomorrow morning."*

32\.
>[20]	*And this week was sent to me headlines in the paper of big hundred-thousand-dollar homes cricking and cracking, and people moving away. They don't know how to stop it; there is no way to stop it. See, God can do whatever He wants to, and there's nobody can tell Him how to do it.*

And, of course, the sovereignty of God is based upon the Scripture, *"earthquakes in divers places."* And if God said there's earthquakes, and His prophet prophesied---from face-to-face contact with God---that *"the West Coast would fall in,"* then he's going to talk about that, which is in his generation, which is true and it will fall in.

>[21]	*You build homes; you can make scientific things, but God is the creator of science* (or anything that we take and call science; God's behind it.) *How are you going to stop Him?* (He's going to do what He wants to do with it.) *He can destroy the earth this morning by fleas if He wants to. Do you realize He could speak fleas into existence, and they'd be forty miles deep in a half hour's time, see, [...] eat people right off the ground. He is God! He does just as He will. He is sovereign in Himself.*

Now, you know animals can destroy fleas, and animals can destroy babies. They can destroy people. You could drown in them, or they could just eat you up. It wouldn't matter. See? Too many to handle.

33\.
>[22]	*Now, seeing all this accumulation of evidence of the hour that we now live in, I think it's a good thing to rehearse these things and draw them out, since the Seals have been opened, and find out the truth of these things, as God has been so loyal to us with His grace to show us these things.*

In other words, the message of grace is going to reveal God's grace to us in this end time of absolute deceit where only the very elect will not be deceived. Now, it doesn't say elect; it says very elect. Now remember; if Bro. Branham's statement is correct, and it is correct, he said, *"All right, [...] we take a piece of cloth and we lay a pattern on it."* Now he said, *"That is wise and foolish virgin like in a mixing pot."* Okay. Now the master tailor lays the pattern on the piece of cloth, takes his scissors and cuts it out, and the cloth that remains is no different from the cloth that's in the pattern, but one is in a special pattern. And the special pattern gets the revelation. The other doesn't do it. So, except for a very, very few, they succumb. The very few will not succumb.

So therefore, as we read what Bro. Branham says here, *"The anointed ones at the end time, this sermon is part of the Seven Seals because it reveals what is going on."* And, remember, this is necessary to get us out of here because of ourselves we could not know it. It tells you that. It tells you flat. When somebody says here, there, you don't listen, but at the same time there has got to be someone that does know because Matthew 25 tells us, *"Behold, the Bridegroom,"* and those that do, come out, and they go in and the rest do not. And they miss the beholding in lacking the oil. See? In other words, they are not truly baptized with the Holy Ghost, and we'll see how they can have actually all that looks like the real thing---the real baptism, everything---but it is not. Okay.

34\.
>[23]	*I want you to notice here in Matthew 24, Jesus used the term [...] 'christs'; c-h-r-i-s-t-s, 'christs.' Not 'Christ', but 'christs', plural---not singular, plural...Therefore, the word 'Christ'* (singular) *means 'the anointed one.' And then, if it's 'anointed,' there will be not only one but many anointed, 'the anointed ones.' See?* (The anointed ones of the last hour.)

>[24]	*And otherwise, if He wanted to break it down so we would more or less understand it better, He'd say,* "In the last days there shall [be] false anointed ones."

Anointed people, false. Well, we've got a little picture of that in Matthew chapter 7. Let's just take a look at It. Not too hard to get to It. And It says here, I think about verse 15, I don't know where it is.

> (15) Beware of false prophets, (they shall) come to you in (sheep) clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. (Why, they look exactly like sheep, but they're not. They're wolves. Exactly.)

> (16) (You) shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?

> (17) Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

Now, you're talking about fruit trees. What was the fruit tree in the Garden that they couldn't eat? It was the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. So, it was wrong, but there was a tree there of Life and they turned It down. So therefore, we have two trees amongst us again. We have the same Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and we have the Tree of Life. And what was the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil? It was the disobedience to the Word of Almighty God through misinterpretation and unbelief. See? Eve turned down the revelation God Himself gave. God revealed Himself, gave His Own revelation. Told her what? [She] turned it down. So therefore, you've got the same thing today. Now you've got a bunch of prophets that are taking the place of the beast to take you to the tree of death.

35\.
> (18)	A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, (Okay.) neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. (Serpent couldn't do anything but what he did.)

> (20) (Therefore) by their fruits ye shall know them.

> (21) Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; (and so on, you can see the picture right there. So you've got the true, you've got the false, and God says It.)

> [24]	*Now, that seems almost impossible* (to us.) *...The terms...'anointed.' But notice the very next words, '...false prophets,' plural.* (Now, watch carefully.)

> [25]	*Now, 'anointed one' is 'one with a message.'*

Now, this is a categorical statement and here is where only the elect are going to believe. Because, look, I can understand this, you're human, I'm human, and it's too easy to say, *"Okay, boy, prove it."* Where do you get the business that the anointed one has a message? Couldn't he come along and be anointed with no message? No, he can't because that's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. Now there's lots of people that don't even have to be anointed to have a message, but we're not talking about those. We're talking about this in the Bible; Matthew 24. So, let's stick to the subject. Right?

36\.
>[25]	*Now, 'anointed one' is 'one with a message.' And the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed, and that would be a prophet---anointed.* "There shall rise false, anointed teachers." *A prophet teaches what his message is. Anointed teachers, but they are anointed people with false teaching---'anointed ones': 'christs,' plural; 'prophets,' plural. And if there...is such a thing as a 'Christ' singular, then these would have to be 'anointed ones,' that their prophecy of what they were teaching would be the difference, because they are anointed ones---anointed.*

In other words, we have an 'alpha and an omega' situation here. Christ was the prophet, and He was refuted by people in that hour. The Omega is Christ the entire Holy Spirit visits the church---the Gentiles---manifests and proves that He is He, and this time it is trickier still because, though Israel came against Christ, they came against Him pedantically, not by signs and wonders. Today Christ will be denied and challenged through His own power that He gives to people by signs and wonders. So, these people will attempt to use a vindication. But, remember, we have a prophet here speaking face-to-face with God. And you can say, *"I don't believe it."*

That's okay; believe anything you want. I'm teaching those that do believe because that's my ministry. Just bringing to their attention what they already know. Okay.

This little paragraph 25 is God's own revelation of His Own Word---that is, God's Own revelation of His Own Word here by His Own prophet---and this is a statement, a definition which is on the basis of *"Take it or leave it; you do what you want with it,"* because Bro. Branham would often say, *"You do what you want with It."* Here It is, leave It, take It, do whatever you want.

37\.
> [26]	*Now, it's a Sunday school lesson, so we want to try to bring this to a real showdown, by the Scriptures, not by what someone else has said about it, but by reading the Scriptures.* (And so now he's got to prove his definition by Scriptures, that is, something out of the Bible.)

>[27]	*You may say,* "How can this be? [...] What were they?" *'Christs,' c-h-r-i-s-t-s, 'anointed christs and false prophets.' Anointed ones, but false prophets!*

As I said the word in the Greek 'kai' [2532] can be 'and' or a preposition which is 'even.' False prophets! See? That's Christ, false Christs, even lying prophets. That's what the Bible actually says they are. Okay. The Christs are prophets. They are not Christ and prophets; they are Christ-prophets, the same thing---one and the same. So, Bro. Branham is going to use the Scripture.

>[28]	*Jesus said that* "the rain falls on the just and unjust." *Now, someone might say to me,* "Do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit?" *Yes, sir, the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon a person, and yet they are false! Now, listen close and see what He said:* "And they shall show signs and wonders, insomuch that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible." *And they are anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit! I know this sounds very foolish, but we're going to take time to explain it by the Word, that that's absolutely THUS SAITH THE LORD, the Truth.* (Okay.)

Brother Branham said at the end time, so truly, and the Scripture bears it out (his own little illustration), he said, *"The two spirits are so close at the end time, they're just a razor blade between them."* Now, you've got to admit that that statement has to be true or how could only the very elect miss it; that is, miss condemnation. See? Now, here's where the Pentecostals went astray on this very statement. And they are anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit.

38\.	Now Bro. Branham says:

>[28]	"Do you believe that the anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit?" *Yes, sir, the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon a person, and yet they are false!*

All right. You hear a Roman Catholic speaking in tongues. Pentecostals unequivocally say, *"The evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues, and, if you speak in tongues, you have got it."* Now, I know that is what they say---although their own theologians admit they cannot prove it. Now, don't let a Pentecostal tell me different because I know what they teach. I was in Pentecost for many, many, many years. I've read the books. I know the doctrine.

I met the man that perpetrated the greatest error upon Pentecost that every lived. What's his name? Joe, out there in California, brilliant, educated man, university professor: thousands and thousands spoke in tongues under his ministry.

39\.	Now, here are the Roman Catholics speaking in tongues. Josephine Ford is their theologian, a woman theologian. I believe she's in Notre Dame, and she stands before the people with Dr. Rev. Father O'Connor, and she said, *"You people may wonder how the Holy Ghost feels in the Roman Catholic Church; He feels right at home."*

And she comes right behind, and she said--- lets them know: *"Don't you try to interfere with our doctrine. I will kiss the pope's toe and make him Jesus Christ, and even a pope can speak in tongues,"* like the pope's sister did, Pope John XXIII; nieces and nephews.

And Pentecost must admit they've got the Holy Ghost, though they pray to dead people and believe in a pope. No way you can get around it.

You say, *"Well, I believe, you see, but it is fake."*

Don't tell me that. These people are healing the sick. Then they'll say, *"Well, the devil can do that, too."*

Now they blaspheme the Holy Ghost.

40\. And Pentecost is the cream of the crop. They're the last little bit that came the closest, but they took the error. Very strange they should take an error. The father of Pentecost asked four young men. Why ask four young men that weren't stalwart students of God, seasoned, to look in the Bible and find the evidence of the baptism? They came up with tongues. That's not the evidence. The Bible doesn't teach that. That's a historical description in how He fell and what went on.

Why didn't they go back to the day of Pentecost when everybody saw flames of fire? Don't let those that claim the Holy Ghost, where somebody saw a flame of fire? Why don't you take all of it back? No. Why did men like Dr. Lemming, Dr. Gray---outstanding theologians---say this: *"Look, that's not the evidence. That's a gift"*? Pentecost never was one; they were always divided. Always was, always will be. Now they've got everything in their midst. Now they become a catalyst, unifying factor for all the churches. I've nothing against them; it's just a pitiful thing.

41\.	But I'm just showing you how this can work here because once you take a thing wrong you are stuck. You'll go all the way with it. So that's what I'm saying this morning from this sermon. Either we're going to get the truth or we're going to get a lie. And if we get the truth, we're stuck with the truth; if we get a lie, we're stuck with the lie. And there's a little group somewhere that's not going to get stuck with anything but the truth. She's going to have the truth, and it's going to get her there. And the rest are not going to have the truth, and they're not going to get there.

Now, there'll be a bunch make it at the White Throne because virgins are virgins. *"As in Adam all died, even so in Christ all will be made alive."* And don't you forget it. That's the Word; we stand on the Word. It was Adam and Eve's job, no matter how they did it, to populate the earth. It went from the life of the Word to the life in the blood---as Geoff Hall brought it out so beautifully here---and that's where it went, but they are nonetheless sons of God. Right! It's the life that God breathed in Adam that got him moving and Eve moving, breath of lives, man became a living soul, was in the plural. I don't care how they got here, they're still those sons and daughters. And I don't care what status they have; they will still be in. So God has a status, and you look at the Scripture at the White Throne judgment, you're going to find the Blood is not mentioned. No sir, you're going to find they weren't born again. It could get as far as being saved; they can be as far as being sanctified, but the Blood had not truly availed to the extent where the Holy Ghost came in. Had the Blood truly availed, they would have been clean for the Holy Ghost to come in. So, all right. They weren't filled with the Holy Ghost, but they'll come up at that time. That's what happened to the foolish virgin in Matthew 25; they don't make it. See? All right.

42\.
>[29]	*Now let's turn in our Bibles [...] to Matthew the 5th chapter, verse 45, and see now as we read for a few moments in these Scriptures [...] If we fail to read them all, then you get your Bible, and you can read them after you leave here and you go home. You can read what the Bible says about it.*

>[30]	*Now we'll take our time, to get a basic fact, because I'm making a statement [...] that's astounding. How can the Holy Spirit anoint a false teacher? [...] That's what Jesus said would happen.*

Now, the fundamentalist cannot believe it; there's no way. And the legalist cannot believe it, and the Pentecostals are legalists. Now, they're not so foolish as to think the devil can heal. I don't think they've ever come that far off. Well, if they have, I don't know. I've been out of it for so long.

>[30]	*Now, Matthew, the 5th chapter, the 45th verse. Let's [...] begin a little [...] the 44th:*

> But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, [and] pray for them that despitefully use you, and persecute you.

Now, Bro. Branham read that so we get a right attitude toward these people. Don't worry about them. He never spoke evil of men like Allan, though Allan died, evidently, a drunkard and a man that was gonged up and messed up, that took people's money---widows, anybody else---it didn't bother him, as long as he got it. He spent it like a drunken sailor. I've got proof of that. I'm not lying in the pulpit up here. Built--- Did foolishly.

43\.	Where's Oral Roberts today? Held hostage by God for four and a half million dollars. I can't believe that, unless it's like Amy. When Bro. Branham said, *"I don't doubt God called her; He knew she was going to go anyway."* Just like Baalam. It could be that; I don't know. But I can't buy that being of God, not when he saw the prophet, William Branham, turn down one and a half million bucks at one crack. Do you realize William Branham--- Mr. Roberts would have looked like a...Well, what would he look like? A ha'penny? When he looked like a shilling, alongside of William Branham. He'd have passed the hat. Turned it down. See? But his attitude was always right toward those men, called them beloved brothers and cautioned them, dealt with them, and was a very fine brother. They cannot say that Bro. Branham ever hurt any of those men. he stuck to his word. He had to do the calling God gave him.

44\.
>[30]	(Now.) *That you may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and...the good, and sends rain on the just and...the unjust. (The rain comes upon the evil the same as it comes upon the good.)*

>[31]	*Now to follow this up, [on] another prophecy pertaining to this, may we turn to Hebrews the 6th chapter [...] where Paul is bringing back to mind the same thing that Jesus said. [...] While you're hunting it...And you [on] the broadcast, get your Bibles near you and a piece of paper, and look this up now. Hebrews the 6th chapter, Paul writing to the Hebrews, showing them the shadows and the types, bringing them from under Judaism to Christianity, showing them how all the old things just foreshadowed the things that were to come.*

Now he's not saying that about Hebrews 6. He's saying that about the Book of Hebrews. Hebrews 6 is not a type of anything. He's telling you flat what's going to happen at the end time.

> [31] *Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ (C-h-r-i-s-t, singular)...let us go on to perfection;* (That's to a conclusion.) *not laying again the foundation of repentance...and dead works, and of faith toward God.*

>*And the doctrine of baptisms, [...] laying on of hands, [...] the resurrection of the dead, [...] eternal judgment.*

>*And this will we do, if God permits.*

>*For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, (I want to call your attention to this just a minute. Did you notice it says, 'gift,' not 'gifts';* (not) *partakers of 'the heavenly gifts' but 'the heavenly gift,' singular. 'Christ,' singular;) 'gift'...heavenly gift,* (the anointing,) *and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost [...]* (Certainly, if you had that you were.)

>*And have tasted...the good word of God...* (Right? The fulfillment of God in their lives, the very Word being fulfilled by those men and all those men.)

>*Taste...the good word of God [...] and the power of the world to come.*

What power of the world to come? Resurrection life, adamic authority, immortality; they merely tasted, they do not get it. Why? There's an anointing there. The real Holy Ghost brings you this. That's why he spoke on the real baptism of the Holy Ghost. See? Now, now notice, they merely taste. We're not commanded to taste; we're commanded to eat. See? Okay.

45\.
>[31]	*If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.*

In other words, at this point they make their minds up as to what is going on and to where they stand, and no one's going to change them. In this hour they are sitting on a fence, but during the hour you've got to get off the fence. You got to make your stand.

>[31]	*For, (Listen!) the earth* (which) *drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, to bring forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessings from God:*

>*But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.*

Now, It says it's nigh to cursing; whose end is to be burned. In other words, I can see here the possibility of foolish virgin actually burning at the end because the whole earth gets burned, but it doesn't necessarily mean they'll be cursed. That's at the White Throne. Then it will be all over. But it could be both. I just leave it there. Okay.

46\.
>[32]	*Now compare this with Matthew 5:24 again. Notice, Jesus said the rain and the sun comes upon the earth, that God sends it to prepare the food and the things for the people of the earth. And the rain is sent for the food, the herbs. But the tares, weeds, being in the field, receive the same thing. The same rain that makes the wheat grow is the same rain that makes the weeds grow.*

Sure! The cow eats the grass that the goat eats, that the pig can eat, that the horse can eat, that the zebra can eat. Who knows what else? Kangaroo, for all I know. They eat grass. I think they do---leaves and things. But what is it? It's life, a supporter of life [...] They're all different lives.

Hey, listen! The beast in the Garden was supported by the same food evidently that Adam and Eve were supported by, or some of the animals. Sure! Depends on the life. So we're talking about now, life. The only difference between wheat and tares, actually, is the life that is in the seed that comes forth. See? Cain's race opened the door to the admixture. Now everybody looks alike. Even the most desperate can look just like a real Christian.

47\.	Now, what if we put the seal of the baptism of the Holy Ghost on speaking in tongues? Everybody say, *"Hey, bless God, we all made a mistake. That is the evidence. Hallelujah!"*

The pope would speak in tongues just like that, and a genuine tongue, and say, *"Well,"* he's *"got the Holy Ghost."*

Well, we said he's got the Holy Ghost, so he's got the Holy Ghost. *"Pope, my dear, you got the Holy Ghost."*

I'm not being crazy; I'm telling you the truth because this is where they backed themselves into a corner. I have backed myself into a corner, there and there, [Bro. Vayle points to the two pictures.] with the prophet, William Branham. And if he's wrong; I'm shot. Do what you want. I can't make my mind up over again because the Bible says here at this time you can't make your mind up over again.

48\.	Do you know your thought processes are stuck? But do you know your thought processes are what are going to change you into immortality? So, aren't you glad your thought processes can get stuck? I'd hate to think mine could get unstuck, and then it's back to me doing it instead of God doing it. And I thought God did the changing. Then if God does the changing, He's going to do it by the means whereby He makes the changes, then God's obligated for the whole thing. That's exactly the truth.

I ask you, did Adam call on God to come and fix things up? God came down like thunder. He did the same thing in the Thunders this time, too, to fix things up! Yes siree! I tell you, it's something to shout about. If you don't rejoice, you've got good reason to rejoice; you've got no reason to feel bad. I like the irrevocable, the indestructible. The Bible speaks of the end time: It says everything changes but God. Everything falls down but God. *"Thou remainest, oh God!"* Certainly! Now you can't change one word of it.

49\.	
>[33]	*How I had such a lesson on that one---* (about the wheat and the tares) *that one time when I first met the Pentecostal people.* (Now Bro. Branham loved Pentecost. He said, *"They are the cream of the crop."*) *And it was a great lesson to me. I saw two men* (speaking...) *I never heard speaking in tongues before. One spoke in tongues, the other one interpreted, and vice versa. And they would tell the truth, and say that,* "There are many in here that should repent tonight. There are men and women, both." *And people would rise up and go to the altar.*

>[34]	*And I thought,* "How glorious!" *And then with the little gift of the Holy Spirit,* (He's talking about his discernment.) *I talked with those men [...] you know how, in discernment,* (I've got a little way to find out). *And one of them was a genuine Christian, and he was a real servant of God. And the other one was a hypocrite. And one of them---the one that was a hypocrite---was living with a black-headed woman, running around with a blond and had children by her.*

That's typical. The Baptist they're running around, too. So don't just think it's Pentecostal. Pentecost are more emotional, but the Baptists are no different. Down in Florida one time, the Baptist preacher wanted, I think, the undertaker's wife, so he ended up killing the undertaker and they both got caught. So much for the Baptist, Southern at that. [Bro. Vayle chuckles.] That's the truth.

When I was in Florida the Church of God fellow, oh, he was puffed up. He really thought he was some big wheel, big wheeler dealer. He wouldn't sell us the church.

*"Well,"* he said, *"Rev. Vayle, if we sold you the church, we'd have to give you little peanuts. We want to get the money out of this; we're building this great big church."*

And he ran off with the contractor's wife. Happy day. One day God's going to run off with His Own true wife. Happier day. I trust we're a part of that great Bride and Groom, that great Bride for that wonderful Groom. Yes sir.

50\.
>[34]	(He was a real hypocrite.) *Well, it was right there in the vision; couldn't be denied. And I spoke to him about it. He looked at me and walked around the building.* (He wouldn't change.)

>[35]	*Now, I was confused sure enough. I thought I had come into angels, then I wondered if I wasn't among devils.* (All right.) *How could this be? I could not understand it. And for years I kept my hands off of it [...]*

Now, that's the policy to always use in your life. Keep your hands off. Just stand back and watch, unless, of course, it's something you know to do something about and then---and aren't doing it. Like the Bible said, *"Him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not,"* you know, it said, *"then to him it's sin."* But this is something that didn't have a thing to do with him. It wasn't in his domain at that time, so just leave it. I have a lot of questions that I just leave with the Lord. Learn the patience of God. I just leave it. You leave it, too.

51\.
>[35]	*[...] until one day... (Where George Smith, the boy that goes with my daughter... We went yesterday to the old mill place where I go to pray.) And after being in there a couple days [...]*

That's--- He's talking now about him and Becky's boyfriend, now her husband, George Smith, went to the place... He showed him that area where he would go to pray---where there's a cave, a limestone cave, where he would go in---and that's where this vision took place many, many years back. So let's keep the sequence right. It wasn't just at the time he was preaching the sermon.

>[35]	*And after being in there a couple days, the Holy Spirit brought this Scripture back to me.* "For the rain cometh oft upon the earth to dress it with herbs, but thorns and thistles live by the same rain [...] whose end is to be burned." *Living by the same life-giving resources [...]*

Now, notice; *"by the same life-giving resources."* He didn't say living by the same life. The weeds and the tares do not have the same life. It's a different. It's like a...Look; all life is a spirit. So this would be like a spirit of botany not a spirit of the...The whole thing is zoology, put it down to that. You get it all in there, but they're different kinds.

52\.
>[35]	*Living by the same life-giving resources of God. Then I understood where...Jesus said,* "By their fruits they are known." (Now he tells the story of this later.)

>[36]	*Now, therefore, the rain dropping down upon the natural vegetation of the earth, is a type of the spiritual rain that gives eternal Life, dropping down upon the Church; for we call it the former rain and the latter rain. And it's a rain, pouring out of God's Spirit upon His Church.*

Now, when we're dealing with life-giving resources here, (And I said it's not the life itself; it's the resources that are in.) what I'm trying to show you is this: God is not unequivocally giving this person His life and the resources thereof for that person to live by. No, that's just the true ones. The false ones He gives this in order to manifest by. See? There's a difference. So you can't say He's giving the life per se for the sake of eternality. He's not. You've got to watch the difference. Okay. He's talking here, then, about rain. All right.

53\.	Let's go to Hosea 6, and we'll see something about rain. 1--3.

> (1) Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, [and] he will bind us up.

> (2) After two days he will revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

> (3) Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; [and] he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

Now, he's giving you the type right here. In the third day, and we're at it. At this time, it's to get ready for the Millennium. So, there's going to be a latter rain and a former rain upon the earth. Christ Himself is going to be responsible for it. Okay.

54\.	We'll go to Joel. I won't say any more about it, but just pass over it. Joel the 2nd chapter, 23 and a little bit on:

> (23) Be glad then, ye children of Zion, (That's the Bride.) [and] rejoice in the LORD your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first... (Now, they've got 'month' there, but that's not so. What it is, is a continuation of the first. We're back to Ephesus. There's another Ephesian church. That's what's 	happening. 'Alpha is omega.' We've gone full cycle.)

> (24) And the floors shall be full of wheat [..] (at that time, when it's no longer moderate. Fullness has come. That which is perfect is here. Full measure of the Word, full measure of Christ---Headship, Cornerstone, Capstone. Full cycle. You're right at the place now to go back to the Millennium.) [And] the floors shall be full of wheat, [and] the vats overflow with (oil and wine).

> (25) And I will restore to you the years the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, [and] the caterpillar, [and] the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.

> (26) And (you) shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that [hath] dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed. (That's got to be the immortality.)

> (27) And (you) shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and [that] I am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be ashamed. (Now, that's us right here because that's New Jerusalem, which is Zion, which is us. Now, watch!)

> (28) (Now) it will come to pass afterward, (In other words, in connection with this, because of this Presence, you watch what happens.) [that] I will pour my spirit upon ('A' double 'L') flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, (and) your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:

> (29) And also upon the servants and upon the (maidens) in (the) days will I pour [out] my spirit (saith the Lord). (Now, now watch!)

> (30) (At that time he's going to) shew wonders in the heavens and [in] the earth, blood, and fire, and [pillars of] smoke.

> (31) The sun [shall be] turned into darkness, [and] the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.

> (32) And [it shall come to pass, that] whosoever shall call (upon) the name of the LORD shall be delivered: (see?) for in mount Zion [and in] Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.

In other words, in the Bride alone there is deliverance. Everybody else is wiped out. Now you're at that period.

55\.	Now, we might as well stop right here and go to Acts the 2nd chapter and get the entire picture where Peter takes it up in the Holy Ghost and puts it to our day. And this is tremendous. Okay. 16th verse.

> (16) (And) this is that [which was] spoken by the prophet Joel; (said Peter talking at Pentecost, the gifts of the Spirit in evidence which was both tongues and interpretation and prophesy.)

Now, remember, the people were prophesying but the people heard them in their own languages, so therefore, there could be some tongues there as they came down in the street, I don't know. Up in the upper room there was some tongues, but the actual big thing was prophecy and the miracle lay in the hearing, not the speaking. Anybody knows that that knows Scripture.

56\.	Now, watch! Verse 17.

> (17) [And] it (will) come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour [out of] my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and [your] daughters shall prophesy, [and] your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:

> (18) And on my servants (Now, this is on yours and this is on mine, see.) [...] I will pour (my Spirit in those days); and they shall prophesy:

> (19) And I will (be shewing those) wonders [...] and signs [...]

Here was the great One, the sign of the Son of man coming in the heaven right there. [Bro. Vayle points to the picture of the Cloud.]

You say, *"Well, I don't know if I agree with that."*

Well, you do what you want about it. I believe that. It's got to happen sometime. It's never happened before. That never happened.

You say, *"Well, maybe It will happen again."*

Well, you wait for It. You wait for It. When did God have to repeat Himself?

You say, *"I don't know if It is God."*

I don't know either; I believe It is. I can't say, *"Hey God, whatever is it?"*

What if the Pillar of Fire did come to me: how would I know it was God? I wouldn't know for sure it was God. I'd have no way; I'm not a prophet. I don't even have a Pillar of Fire. I've got to come the way God said. William Branham was a prophet, born a prophet. Absolutely! People know he's a prophet. They just don't know what side he's on. He's on God's side as long as he preaches their stuff. He's on the devil's side as soon as he preaches God's stuff or his own stuff. You know what I'm talking: his own thing, his own word.

57\.	Now, here you got two kinds of people: God's people and the other people. So now we really have a quandary, but we see Bro. Branham entirely vindicated by the Scripture and by his vision. The Scripture bears out there are a people at the end time, positively, with signs and wonders that are as phony as the devil himself. Then there are those in between that are foolish virgin, and they're not phony; they just haven't gone on to receive the Holy Ghost. They can't take the Word. They stop at a tongues evidence and anointing when they should have gone all the way. Didn't do it. See? 	

58\.
>[37]	*Notice, it's a very strange thing here. See? When those seeds went into the ground, however they got there, they were thorns to begin with. But there like the wheat that went in the ground...the herbs were herbs to begin with. And each herb* (bearing,) *producing itself, over again, showed that it was in the original beginning.*

>[38]	"And they will deceive the elected if it were possible," *because they're getting the same rain, the same blessing, showing the same signs, the same wonders.*

Now, I know that people cannot take that. They can't do it. But except for this I would have quit the whole thing years ago and said we're back to where we were. We're back to Pentecost with all its odiferous connotations, its stinkiness, its rottenness, their lies, their chicanery, their legalistic, self-righteous, puffed-up hierarchy that act as though they're God. They are people that cover their sins with their talking in tongues. I've been all through it. Don't tell me. I'm not exactly bitter, but I've been all through that hogwash. So don't try to tell me; I've preached for them. I know their circles, their inner workings. I've been around their great men, and there were great men till it was all over, then they had to die like the rest did because the seed of death was planted.

The seed of death was planted in the Ephesian church, my brother/sister. They died. And don't tell me Pentecost wouldn't have seeds planted of death. I get so fed up with the denominational hogwash and claptrap and balderdash because people will not let their thinking go. They still want to retain that which is in error and of the devil. Don't do it. If you ever took a bath today, you take a bath today not just in the Blood, but you get in the River of Water that's flowing from the Mercy Seat, brother/sister, or you aren't going to get anywhere. You think you believe this Message, you better check yourself out and see if you really do, see if you understand it, see what you've got still left in your heart of your old doctrines and dogmas. That will tell you if you got anything or not because It says, *"Leave them."* Absolutely! You come on where perfection is, the true Word of Almighty God...said right there.

59\.	Now he said:

>[38]	*Now, a thorn cannot help being a thorn, and neither can wheat help being a wheat; it's what the Creator of each one determined at the beginning. That's the elected.*

Then you say, *"Why do you haul off and hit us so hard?"*

Because I'm making sure you're wakened up. If you're seed, you'll gets what coming to you. If you're not, you won't want it anyway. It lets you know there's a difference. See, there's a big difference. See, they'll deceive the very elected if it were possible because they're getting the same rain, the same blessing, showing the same signs, the same wonders, deceive all but the elect; it's not possible. A thorn's a thorn, a wheat's a wheat; that's the way they were in the beginning, that's the way they are now. But, of course, you're seeing the harvest. Okay. 39th paragraph.

60\.
>[39]	*The sun rises of a morning and spreads across the earth, as it had this urban day that we live.*

Now, he used the word 'urban,' the word 'urban,' if that's the right word, as opposed to 'rural.' And when I think of urban, then I think right away, okay what he's got in mind is this: The urban day is Lot sitting at the little city full of homosexuality. No longer are the people pastoral, no longer out there, communing with the earth, no matter of the tilling the ground and doing the right thing; they're all in great big cities. Babylon is a great big city, and we're all called Babylon. *"Come out of her, my people:"* this urban day, this great city day, this great city of hell---not the city of God; the city of the devil.

>[39]	*And the same sun that rises in the east is the same sun that sets in the west. [And] the sun that is sent to ripen the grain upon the earth, which our bodies are made from.*

Malachi 4: the Sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in His wings. Going to take that dirt and remold it, recreate it, and make it like unto His Own glorious Body. He's rising upon it now. He's risen to do that very thing. The Lord Himself has descended with the Shout, the Voice of the archangel, the Trump of God.

61\.	He said:

>[40]	*We are living by dead substance. That's the only way you can live. And if something has to die every day so you live, in the natural, then isn't it true that if your body has to live by dead substance, for natural life, then you've got to have something die spiritually to save your spiritual life? And God, became material, flesh, and died that we might live. There's no church, no other thing in the world can save you but God. There's the only thing that they* (can) *live by.*

And so he's pointing out here that the true Holy Ghost that you live by is what you want---not simply an anointing upon your flesh that's going to die---and you can have It according to Scripture because Peter said, *"They that call upon the name of the Lord in this they shall be saved,"* and it's that Spirit that came to give us His Name that you can call upon. Let the Blood wash you clean and the Holy Ghost [...] help you escape out of this world.

62\.	Brother, it's not impossible. It's just give your heart to God this morning, sitting in your seat, or any time you stand by your beds, whatever you do, give your heart to God. Don't look to me or anybody else. Just give your heart to God, say, *"Lord Jesus Christ, I want your cleansing Blood. I want the Holy Spirit."* And pile Word upon Word, you'll be full of the Holy Ghost, live a life of victory. Not going to have any emotion, any big signs, but you'll know you're changed. People around you know you've changed. I look at people come in here, why they're far and far apart and pretty soon they begin to mellow down, and I see there's a change. They don't even know it themselves but there's a change. Pile the Word upon Word in your lives; see what's going to happen. Don't look to Pentecost. Don't look to this church, that church. Look to God. Let Him give you that Word wherein there's life, and you'll find the life you want. There's no place else, brother/sister.

Let's rise at this time and be dismissed.

Gracious, heavenly Father, we come to You this morning as we dismiss for ourselves from this place, Lord, not from Your Presence because You go with us Lord, not though the Pillar of Fire but a little bit of that Pillar of Fire in each one of us going with us, and the great Pillar of Fire here to raise the dead, having brought us the message to get us all together to get us out of here in the glory land.

Father, I pray that not one person shall leave here without hope this morning but each one realize I can, I will by the grace of God be in that great...in that little group that gets out of here. Know there's trouble ahead, sure there is. There always has been trouble; always will be but where there is pressure there is going to be grace, where there is sin there is---grace will more abound. Where there is death, life will abound. Where there is darkness, light will come in and dispel the darkness. Just one little light, just one little match lit dispels the darkness. But Lord, You Yourself have lit up our Western skies and the Light has arrived; It's risen upon us, shined upon us, immortality in our midst. All these things are ours today, Lord, we know that they are true and we give them back to You waiting for that day when the life---Your life---hits these very words that we give back to You and we become immortal with them, eternal with them in the sense of a manifestation.

Father, I pray that not one person in this building shall leave here sick this morning. Help each one of us, O God, to receive strength from You, Lord, the healing. Doesn't matter upon age, Lord, we know that, maybe strength does but we realize that we can all be healed, perfect for the day and the hour in which we are living, Father. We know there's atonement, all these things are there. They're for us. My God, may we receive this morning. We'll give You the honor and glory, and unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God be all that honor and glory through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

*"Take the Name of Jesus with You."*
